On  "Burma's Bloody Sunday"  yesterday, 18 peaceful protestors were shot dead (28 Feb 2021).  CNN's Christiane Amanpour, producer Andrew Tkach, and cameraman Mark Phillips witnessed the Burmese people's last battle against the military dictatorship 13 years ago after the Saffron Revolution . Today's protestors now face the same murderous military junta and desperately need the world's support.
