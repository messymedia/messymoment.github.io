Michael Stewart died tragically on September 1983 after he was arrested by NYC Transit police officers for the "crime" of writing graffiti. Stewart was a young artist and dancer, who appeared in one of Madonna's first music videos. None of the officers involved in his arrest were ever convicted for his death. Long before systemic racism of police forces was understood to be a problem, Andrew Tkach produced this story for CNN Special Assignments just after finishing journalism school.
