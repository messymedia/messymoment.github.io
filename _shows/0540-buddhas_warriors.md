How do followers of a religion preaching non-violence battle against authoritarian regimes and political oppression?  That's the question  examined by producer Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christiane Amanpour  in the hour long documentary -  Buddha's Warriors, the last in a series of CNN documentaries that looked  at the role religion plays in contemporary politics. Just days before the largest Tibetan uprising in decades, the Dalai Lama tries to answer this question, while  confronting young Tibetans who are frustrated with the results of  pacifism. The second half of the documentary focuses on the  brutally suppressed protest movement of  Burma's  Buddhist monks, when they challenged the country's military dictatorship.  The program includes undercover filming by Andrew Tkach and Mark Phillips inside the previously sealed country.
