Should the right to name a newly discovered  primate species be auctioned off to the highest bidder,  to pay for conservation?  That's what wildlife biologist Robert Wallace did after discovering the charismatic creature deep in the Bolivian Amazon.  Producer Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christian Amanpour report from one of the most bio-diverse   national parks on earth - Madidi.  The accompanying half hour show in Spanish documents the work of the Wildlife Conservation Society with indigenous communities in Bolivia.
