Ukraine's  revolutionaries  took on a powerful autocrat and triumphed on Maidan  by putting their lives on the line in the main square in Kyiv, Ukraine. From the first days of the protest a team of local filmmakers called Babylon13 volunteered to capture history in the making. In dangerous daily sorties, they filmed the first hopeful days of the movement and later the bloody street battles on their hand held DSLRs.  The day after the massacre of 100 protestors when emotions were still smoldering, Director Andrew Tkach  selected the main characters to interview and profile.  This 10 minute excerpt  is part of a feature length documentary called "Generation Maidan: A Year of Revolution & War."
