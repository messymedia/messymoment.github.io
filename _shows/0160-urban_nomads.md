Urban Nomads, produced by Andrew Tkach in 1987,  is an hour long WCBS documentary about homeless teenagers surviving on the streets of NYC.  Today, according to the largest victims' services agency in the United States, nationwide  1.7 million young people call the streets home.  5000 die every year because of "assault, illness or suicide." Almost half escaped physical abuse at home.  This is the often brutal story of how they survive on the streets.
