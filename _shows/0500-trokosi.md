Producer Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christiane Amanpour investigate traditional slavery in Ghana where young girls are forced to pay for the sins of their ancestors by becoming the wives of village priests.   The program aired on CBS News 60 Minutes. More than 20 years ago  we met a young slave girl while filming this story and our feature led to her freedom. Now an educated and articulate young woman, Brigitte Perenyi tells her own story in My Stolen Childhood. Watch it on BBC https://bbc.co.uk/programmes/n3ct4f1r
