Producer Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christiane Amanpour take a look at the AIDS orphan crisis faced by Kenya and all of  sub Saharan Africa.  Despite the bleakness of the subject matter, the film finds hope in the heroic response of  grandmothers, caregivers and  orphans surviving at the very margins of their societies  . The CNNI documentary was the first in a series of  Emmy nominated programs produced by this team. Mark Phillips was the cameraman, Lisa Jell was the editor.
