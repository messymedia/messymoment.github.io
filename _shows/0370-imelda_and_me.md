Imelda and Me looks at impunity for political crimes in the Philippines, both when Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos ran the country and more recently,  when 32 members of the press were murdered.  It was  the world's single biggest attack ever on journalists.  The risks for media workers are now even greater after newly elected president Duterte said "just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you're a son of a bitch," referring to those who may be corrupt.  It's dangerous rhetoric that endangers all journalists say the Union of  Philippine journalists and Amnesty International.   This is part of an hour long documentary Andrew Tkach produced  for the Al Jazeera English show  Correspondent,  with Veronica Pedrosa.
