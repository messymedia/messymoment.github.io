“Hunger For Truth” tells the story of Rhea Clyman, a courageous Canadian reporter who uncovered a “crime of the century” - Stalin's man-made famine in Ukraine. The film interweaves Clyman's unescorted reporting trip in 1932 during the “Holodomor” with today's conflict in eastern Ukraine, focusing on a forgotten prisoner of war.  It shows the power of the truth in the face of disinformation.  Directed by Andrew Tkach the feature length documentary was  coproduced with the Canada Ukraine Foundation & Babylon’13.
