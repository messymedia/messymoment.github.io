This 60 Minute segment produced by Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christiane Amanpour looks at the problem of neglected tropical diseases.  In the poorest parts of Central Africa sleeping sickness was once a bigger threat to than AIDS, but the medicne that could cure it, was taken off the market by the pharmaceutical companies that produced it.   There just  wasn't any profit in selling medicine to people making $1 a day.  But after this segment aired, the companies involved were shamed into donating a multi-year supply of the medicine.     The program won a Robert F. Kennedy International TV Award for highlighting the issue.
