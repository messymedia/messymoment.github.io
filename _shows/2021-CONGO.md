In an age when zoonotic diseases have paralyzed the planet, Congo's Call of the Wild examines an outbreak threatening our closest primate relatives, the bonobos. Bushmeat hunters entering their reserve have inadvertently spread human diseases, but as today's pandemic shows diseases can go either way. The hour long documentary also looks at efforts to protect Africa's largest rainforest - Congo's Salonga National Park and examines controversies surrounding anti-poaching patrols and community conservation efforts. Directed by Olivier Grancher, Darbaitar Mohamed, Katya Katondolo and Andrew Tkach, the upcoming film is part of the Giving Nature a Voice series of environmental films made in Africa.
