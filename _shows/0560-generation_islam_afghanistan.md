This hour long CNN documentary examines the battle for the hearts and minds of Muslim youth  in Afghanistan,  following President Obama's  speech in  Cairo. It was produced by Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christiane Amanpour.  The hour is framed by the  personal  choices made by  two brothers, as they struggle to survive in a harsh world  of religous extremism and extreme poverty.
