Many of the thirty somethings who led the Maidan Revolution  are not  starry eyed idealists expecting an easy victory over Ukraine’s corrupted  elite.  They've seen  their hopes dashed before after the Orange Revolution. Activist now parliamentarian Hanna Hopko  says this fight is as  tough as the one they waged against the riot police.   “Now we are fighting for the future of the country, “  she said.  Dmytry Shymkiv who heads President Poroshenko's  reform efforts, launched several successful startups before he became president of Microsoft Ukraine.  "This whole country is a startup, " he said, before rolling his head at the Soviet style super secure phones crowding his desk.  " We have to kill half of the bureaucracy we inherited from the Soviet past ."   This report  produced  by  Andrew Tkach and correspondent Sheila MacVicar from Al Jazeera America,  was filmed by  Babylon'13.
