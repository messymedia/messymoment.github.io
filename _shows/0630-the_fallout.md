Two  years  after the most powerful earthquake in Japan's history and the devastating tsunami, the people of Fukushima are still dealing with the fallout of the triple meltdown at a nearby nuclear power plant.  Travel inside the exclusion zone, set up around the crippled plant with factory owners and  ranchers who refuse to slaughter their radiated herd.  Follow the often futile cleanup in the communities just outside the evacuation zone and learn the price they have paid for Japan's embrace of nuclear power.  The complete half hour program called The Fallout  was produced for the NBC newsmagazine Rock Center by Andrew Tkach with correspondent Richard Engel. David Lom was the cameraman.
