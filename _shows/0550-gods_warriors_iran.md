To examine the Shiite tradition of martyrdom, producer Andrew Tkach, correspondent Christian Amanpour, and cameraman Mark Phillips travelled to Iran during the holy days of Ashura, when the streets of Tehran are filled with mournful marchers and back rooms resonate with the chants of true believers. This half hour segment was part of the CNN Series God's Warriors, that examined the role of religion in politics.  It won a Dupont Silver Baton and a Peabody award.
