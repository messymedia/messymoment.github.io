If  portable cameras existed during the French Revolution, this is what a chronicle of the barricades might have looked like.  Ukraine's social upheaval  happened five years ago.  Just like in France, it was also followed by foreign invasion, and attempted counter revolution, while the true believers tried to keep the hopes of their movement alive.
