In one of  Russia's biggest maritime tragedies,  over sixty people died in April when the factory ship the Dalniy Vostok sank quickly in the frigid waters off Kamchatka Peninsula.  Investigators blamed "greed and corruption" after the ship was pulled down by 80 tons of fish.  By sheer coincidence, Andrew Tkach and a crew from National Geographic visited the  original ship when it flew the flag of the USSR to document what was then the only big American Soviet joint venture.  The film captures how ordinary Americans and Russians managed to  overcome the hostility of their governments and work together on the high seas.
