The Artivist, a 30 minute documentary produced by Andrew Tkach, explores online dissent in China, the world’s largest community of internet citizens. The netizens’ rambunctious godfather, artist/activist  Ai Weiwei,  spells out his personal philosophy in a freewheeling interview just before his arrest.  The  documentary,  which   premiered at Geneva’s Human Rights Film Festival in 2013,  is an expanded version of  “The Dissident Dissapeared.”  first aired on  Dan Rather Reports/ HDTV.  It also  shows ordinary Chinese citizens breaking through the state’s Great Firewall  while investigating   illegal land seizures, local corruption and the suspicious deaths of local activists. Les Mulkey edited the show.  Tres Silencio composed the music.
