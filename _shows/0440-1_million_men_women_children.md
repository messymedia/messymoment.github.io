How do you seek justice in Rwanda where almost everyone knew a victim or perpetrator of the genocide?  Producer Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christiane Amanpour try to answer that question by visiting the harrowing scenes of the slaughter and the prisons  where those accused of perpetuating the genocide await their day in court.  The program aired on CBS News 60 Minutes.
