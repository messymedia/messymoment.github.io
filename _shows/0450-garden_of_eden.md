What is the future for Africa's lowland gorillas, some of whom have never had contact with humans.  In Gobon's Langoue Bai they are protected, as explorer/ecologist  Mike Fay, showed our CBS 60 Minute team.  But illegal logging and the bush meat trade it encourages threaten their future.  This striking report, produced by Andrew Tkach, Alissa Krimsky, and correspondent Christiane Amanpour was  filmed by Chris Everson, Ian Robbie and Anton Von der Merwe. It  won an Emmy for best feature reporting in a news magazine.
