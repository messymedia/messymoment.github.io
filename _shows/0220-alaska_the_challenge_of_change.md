In just one decade, the Inuit town of Barrow, Alaska was transformed by the oil boom from America's northernmost outpost of subsistence hunters to one of the richest municipalities in the United States  Producer Andrew Tkach and cameraman Mike  Phelan  documented the profound changes the people experienced  in the 1980's for CNN's  Special Assignments Unit.  They also trekked on the sea ice with an  Inuit hunter who warned of the consequences of a major oil spill in the Arctic.
