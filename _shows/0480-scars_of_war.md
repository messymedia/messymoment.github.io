Can you remove the physical and mental scars from children who were forced to be soldiers and commit horrible atrocities.   In Sierra Leone some of them were even branded with the initials of the rebel armies that conscripted them, to stop the child soldiers from escaping.  Now that the guns are silenced a surgical team will remove the letters that were etched on their chests or foreheads.  It's a critical first step  to  allow the children to come home.  This moving 60 Minutes report was produced by Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christiane Amanpour and videotaped by Chris Everson.
