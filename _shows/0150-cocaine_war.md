Cocaine War looks at America's often futile war on drugs.   The hour long program was produced by one of the original teams from CBS 48 Hours,  including Bob Lange, Brett Alexander, Lance Heflin and Andrew Tkach, who traveled to the primitive jungle labs of  Bolivia and the private ranch  of  Roberto Suarez, a wealthy cattleman dubbed "the king of cocaine" before his arrest and subsequent death.
