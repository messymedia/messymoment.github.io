War Within explores the real ideological battle confronted by the Muslim community in the West; between moderates and a small group of extremists.   In the wake of the 7/7 terrorist attacks in London, producer Andrew Tkach and correspondent Christiane Amanpour take a look at this critical debate in Great Britain.  It's the second documentary produced by this team,  that was nominated for a News and Documentary Emmy.
