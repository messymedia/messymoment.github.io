How did a Los Angeles street gang become the most dangerous criminal enterprise in the Americas.  That's the story of MS - 13 or Mara Salvatrucha which began with a group of young  Salvadorian immigrants, but morphed into an international criminal syndicate when its members were deported back to El Salvador .  This  is the producer's cut of the hour long documentary  first seen on National Geographic Chanel's show Explorer.  Andrew Tkach is the producer. Lisa Ling is the correspondent.
