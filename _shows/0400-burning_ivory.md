In 2016 Kenya destroyed 105 tons of ivory and rhino horn in the biggest such burning in history. It's part of  the government's strategy to save the African elephant and shame the legal and  illicit trade out of existence.  The move is widely supported by local conservationists like Kuki Gallmann who witnessed the slaughter of  hundreds of elephants at Kenya's largest private conservancy that she runs.  Some of the tusks she recovered before poachers managed to cart them off, was burned in the massive stacks of ivory and sandalwood. The United States supported the campaign by banning all commercial trade in ivory. This mini doc was produced and filmed by Andrew Tkach for the Aga Khan U.
