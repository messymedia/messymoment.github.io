Coastline Crisis is an hour long documentary looking  at the condition  of the nation's coastlines and how it impacts fishermen making a living from the sea.   Producer Andrew Tkach and fisherman/environmentalist Gary Burris were sent on a year long mission by CNN's founder, Ted Turner,  to gauge the health of the American coast.  This is what they found 25 years ago, including many prophetic warnings from scientists and fishermen, on the dangers of over fishing, offshore oil development in the Gulf, toxic wastes and the destruction of Louisiana's marshlands.
